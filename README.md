# Mileage Prediction using Regression Analysis

The objective of this project is to predict mileage using regression analysis techniques. The dataset used for analysis is sourced from StatLibrary, maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. By constructing a regression model, the project aims to estimate the mileage based on a range of predictor variables.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to predict mileage using regression analysis. Regression analysis is a statistical modeling technique that estimates the relationship between mileage and other variables. By analyzing the dataset and constructing a regression model, this project aims to forecast car mileage based on various predictor variables.

## Data Source

The dataset from The StatLibrary dataset comprises data on different car variables, including mileage, engine size, weight, horsepower, and more, collected for the purpose of analysis.
